												<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong><br><br>

During this past week I was reintroduced to strcmp. I've had to implement it before in C, so it wasn't a concept I struggled with. However, the new voting project seems like it will take a decent amount of time and effort, even though I feel like I understand the logic of the algorithm we need to implement.

<br><br><strong>What's in your way?</strong><br><br>

As of now I don't really feel like anything is in my way, but I'm definitely going to have a very packed schedule next week so I want to get as ahead as possible while I still have some free time.

<br><br><strong>What will you do next week?</strong><br><br>

I still need to tackle the majority of the project, and I would like to make some significant progress sooner rather than later because I have to submit my first project for Game Technology next week as well.

<br><br><strong>What was your experience of exceptions, voting, and strcmp?</strong><br><br>

I already had worked with exceptions in prior CS classes, but I found the reintroduction and Dr. Downing's explanation of them to be a very helpful review. Strcmp was already very familiar to me as well, and I feel pretty confident in my understanding of how to implement it. However, the voting project is a lot more complicated than I thought it was initially. Even though I feel like I know how to go about tackling the problem, the way the input is given was really confusing to me at first and I had to put in a lot of thought to get a better idea of what to do.

<br><br><strong>What made you happy this week?</strong><br>br>

I've been really glad the football season has been able to successfully come back without any Coronavirus incidents or outbreaks. It made me pretty happy that the Cowboys were able to mount a 20 point comeback to beat the Atlanta Falcons (aka dirty birds) because I beat my roommate at Fantasy Football.

<br><br><strong>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong><br><br>

My pick of the week is this amazing website called artbreeder.com. Artbreeder has a catalogue of thousands of images both human created and AI-generated that you can upload to or pick from, and each image branches off AI-generated children with different attributes but sharing similarity to the original. It's a crazy amount of fun to play around with and in 5 minutes I had 'created' a painting of a snowy mountain landscape that I wouldn't feel bad framing and putting up.

						<strong>What did you do this past week?</strong><br><br>

This past week, I worked on familiarizing myself with the first project and brushing up on my C++ skills, and began working on the Collatz project. 

<br><br><strong>What's in your way?</strong><br><br>

I still find myself at times needing to brush up on C++, but I'm hopeful that as the semester progresses it'll become a lot more familiar.

<br><br><strong>What will you do next week?</strong><br><br>

For this next week I'll be working on wrapping up my solution for the lab and moving on to project work for my game technology and data management classes.

<br><br><strong>What was your experience of Collatz, the starter code, the makefile, its optimizations, and exceptions? (this question will vary, week to week)</strong><br><br>

So far, I have found the lab to be an interesting first project. Even though I struggled early on to familiarize myself with the new tools like Docker, being supplied the starter code and makefile has been pretty helpful in getting going.

<br><br><strong>What made you happy this week?</strong><br><br>

The football season is back this week, and seeing the New Orleans Saints beat Tampa Bay made me really happy since I'm a Saints fan.

<br><br><strong>What's your pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</strong><br><br>

https://www.ibtimes.sg/razer-data-leak-over-100000-gamers-personal-information-exposed-due-server-misconfiguration-51456</a>
My pick of the week is an article detailing the very recent data leak of gaming company Razer, who exposed over 100,000 users personal data over the course of the past few months due to a misconfigured server. What I found most interesting about this article is that despite being notified of their error almost a month ago, the vulnerability in Razer's system was left exposed up until a few days ago. I think this kind of relates to continuous integration, because if Razer had a previous secure configuration build of their server to roll back to and had continuously been testing their network when they made changes, the discrepancy would have been caught much sooner. It also speaks to the moral disregard of technology companies with consumer data, since Razer had plenty of opportunities to fix their security flaw but rather waited until 100,000 people's data was compromised to take action.

Welcome to my first blog entry for CS371P! My name is Manav Sood, and I grew up and lived in Dallas before coming to UT. I'm looking forward to this class because C++ is one of the main languages I feel that I haven't had the chance to explore as much as I would like but I'm sure by the end of the semester that will change. I'm not a huge fan of the cold calling, but I think its an effective tool to keep everyone engaged in an online environment. My pick of the week is a website called shhgit.com, a real-time tracker of sensitive plaintext and files being uploaded to GitHub. I find it pretty awesome that you can watch your browser screen fill up with sensitive information and secret tokens being dumped onto GitHub with no security regard. It can be found at shhgit.com with source code at https://github.com/eth0izzle/shhgit/.
