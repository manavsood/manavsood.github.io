					<hr class="bottomReveal">
					<p class="bottomReveal">The advent of ever-advancing technology and increased accessibility to network technologies has inevitably made way for the massive growth of the Internet of Things that the world is experiencing today. Each day, ordinary appliances such as stereos, thermostats, microwaves, even water bottles are being made with the technological capacity of being managed remotely through a user’s smartphone. However, the growth of in-band, or internet-connected, devices has brought with it hosts of vulnerabilities to ordinary consumers due to popular corporate attitudes of manufacturing and vending devices without effective security measures for the purposes of maximizing sales and profits. These issues are starting to be addressed. Specifically, a recent piece of legislation, the Internet of Things (IoT) Security Improvement Act of 2017, was proposed in Congress as a way to implement and enforce security standards within businesses and their IoT products. Though the intent of the legislation is undoubtedly applaudable, the unfortunate truth is that it is dangerously weak and therefore ineffective in actually raising the security of IoT end users beyond a marginal amount. Therefore, our proposal is to draft a revised version of the bill that would implement IoT security standards that are much more stringent, and therefore effective, in protecting IoT users.

	Throughout much of our research, we have found much regarding the lack of implementation of effective security standards within many industries, the consequences for which abound. In fact, many of the articles and corporate surveys we have researched suggest that a vast number of companies in the United States alone have been hit with IoT data breaches. It is evident that the impact of IoT breaches on the efficacy of companies’ business operations have staggering magnitudes. However, IoT security flaws also pose dangerous risks to consumers, who sacrifice privacy and security for convenience when using IoT devices. The complex web of information networks formed by the rapid emergence of IoT devices presents a unique risk with implications not only for the private sector, but to infrastructure and national security. With the standards currently in place, this technology is conducive to cyber crime and exploitation on an unanticipated scale. Therefore, the end goal of our original work would be to impose stricter regulation on IoT companies so that they as a well as their consumers are protected from those who would exploit obvious vulnerabilities to extort people and businesses. 

	Obviously, to be able to draft an effective bill that addresses all, if not most, of the current security vulnerabilities of IoT, we would have to conduct careful and in-depth research regarding the needs of IoT consumers, the costs for such implementations, and how companies can incorporate IoT security standards in practice in a scalable and practical way. We intend to conduct this research by scheduling more research interviews with cyber security professionals in hopes of gaining more perspective into what the world of IoT needs. Furthermore, we fully intend to conduct independent research into current security trends/practices and recent IoT-based exploits and data breaches to learn how to better protect and defend from common vulnerabilities being exploited repeatedly.

	Invariably, this task will require not only the extensive research as mentioned previously, but we would also have to apply all of the knowledge we’ve already gained regarding cyber security into forming a set of standards that are geared towards the protection of all IoT consumers. Furthermore, learning how to draft an improved standard, as well as achieving the means to enforce it upon developers and manufacturers, will be a strenuous yet rewarding challenge. We believe that in exploring the relationship between cyber security defense and compliance as well as gaining a deeper technical background through research and industry connection is a unique and exciting way to develop greater understanding and insight into the field and have that knowledge culminate into our original work, which will work to improve society by improving the standards of security across the board for all IoT users.
